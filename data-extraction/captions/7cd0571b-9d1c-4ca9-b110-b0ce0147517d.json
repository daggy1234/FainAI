I just want to point out a couple of structural relationships here, not connected intimately.","So two things I'd like to point out. One,","structural similarity you're going to see again and again you've got iteration in your algorithm that's probably going to correspond to induction.","When you're reasoning about correctness, you've got if statements in your algorithm.","Lo and behold, you got cases and your argument for correctness that's going to show up again and again, that kind of structural similarity.","There's a tight integration between iterative algorithms and the idea of inductive reasoning.","There's a tight integration between using logical if statements and your algorithm and arguing correctness by cases.","So you're going to see that structurally here. Where do we actually say anything about the algorithm?","There were a couple of key steps where we actually used the algorithm in our argument.","Let me just highlight those for you in case you didn't notice it.","One is when we looked at the base case and argued that the variable in after zero iterations of the while loop,","that is to say initially was equal to the maximum of the elements up to including only the zero index element.","Just the very first one. That argument actually followed from the other when I said N0 equals a zero."]},{"start_time":3060,"end_time":3225,"image":"https://duke.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Thumb.aspx?eventTargetPID=695be4f1-5daa-4aed-8cce-b0f90146ad8e&sessionPID=c0e42fcc-9cd5-4e98-bbfd-b0ce01475175&number=17&isPrimary=false&absoluteTime=13349906160.543","captions":["Yes. Question It's really good.","Yeah. Yeah. So the first case is saying that it's a K, so that's K is bigger than the current previous maximum.","Right. So you know, that make is the maximum of everything up to K minus one.","Right. And so if the current value is bigger it must be the new maximum.","Yeah. Because it's bigger than every other element W Except so far.","So then that's the maximum at the point where. Cheney And that's.","K Yeah. We're wondering like in the last line, you see like in case that a index exchange is greater than.","Yeah. So. So what does it mean for something to be a maximum.","Means it's greater than or equal to everything else.","In this case, the inductive hypothesis tells me that arc is greater than or equal to everything prior to K.","And then I'm simply noting, and it's a trivial thing to know I'm trying to be detailed here,","but it is also greater than equal to itself by definition.","So it's greater than equal to everything up to a K, that means it is the maximum by definition of what a maximum is, and the statement in K is equal.","K That's just the algorithm. In this case, the algorithm sets the variable M to be this particular value in Iraq.","So one more thing is that sort of generally the structure of integration is pretty similar, right?","And so the consequences will be context. Right.","And so you if when you are tested on induction, it's going to just like wipe out the first few steps, like the claim the basic is.","And those should most generally follow a similar structure.","So that can be three points.","And just in terms of expectations on induction, this is not a class on writing induction proofs, so you're never going to get a problem exam.","It's like, here's a random mathematical fact, prove it for fun.","That's not going to happen. This is not about algorithms. We're talking about induction here precisely because induction is almost certainly the most","powerful technique for arguing for the correctness of iterative or recursive algorithms.","So you will only ever be arguing using induction in the context of give us an algorithm or look at an algorithm and argue for it something about it,","right?

Random returns, negative one.","And this is because our algorithm will only return something other than negative one.","Yes.

So we are able to. Three. Does that make sense?","Any questions about that you explain to us? Yes.","So the assumption is that.","So we're trying to show that if it's in the range of K minus one and Archie minus one, it's also the nature of are getting right.","And so since the value of old age doesn't change, then we know that and Star is still bigger.","And then when you go to okay minus one. Okay, so now we take our second case.","So an index is less than x.

My favorite constant was to argue that because that was excruciating,","we were going to do something that just is elegant in the sense that you don't have to have a second place.","You don't have to have a separate thing in my algorithm that says, Now that I've only got three elements left, let me check them by brute force.","But you could.
