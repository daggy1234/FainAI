They're not at their capacity.","So some edge like this for the most general case from UDP, currently assigning a flow of five with a capacity of 20.","In the original graph, then in the residual graph we would have two edges a forward edge from you to V with the remaining unused capacity.","Okay. This is our bookkeeping that says hey, we could send at most 15 more flow along the edge.","You'd have the the remaining capacity on that edge and we will define a reverse edge in the opposite direction.","So from V to you instead of from you to B, and the capacity of that reverse edge will be equal to the assigned flow in the original graph.","So five In this case, I will just draw my reverse edges with dashes to help you to visualize the forward versus the reverse edges.","But I do not mean by that that the reverse edges are not edges in the residual graph.","They are edges in the residual graph. Just doing this to help us visually.","Okay, So forward edges, reverse edges will have these two types of edges in our residual network.","The forward edges correspond to how much remaining capacity do I have on an edge?","If I wanted to push more flow along it, the reverse edges correspond to how much edge might be,","how much flow in my already sending across the edge you to V that I could","potentially change my mind about later and decide not to root along due to the.","Given a larger example here. So here is one of our earlier examples of a graph with a flow along.","It removed the notation. I'm showing them the flow, slash the capacity, all of these.","Let's try to define the residual network first. I'll draw the forward edges.","The forward edges. Note Ah, for any of these that have remaining capacity, okay.","And I'll draw those in solid. So for example from S to A, in the original graph we were sending ten units of flow and we had a capacity of 20.","So we have a remaining capacity of ten, we have ten additional capacity we could use,"]},{"start_time":3780,"end_time":3840,"image":"https://duke.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Thumb.aspx?eventTargetPID=216bfec6-d246-426b-9ea4-b1380136440e&sessionPID=e543c35e-e969-47b1-8517-b0ce014753bd&number=21&isPrimary=false&absoluteTime=13355346480.536","captions":["The residual capacity will be equal to the original capacity minus the flow.","So it's just the remaining capacity along that edge.","And for every edge from you to being in your original graph that has a non-zero flow assigned to it,","you will also have a reverse edge in the opposite direction from V2.","You in your residual network and the capacity of that edge will be equal to the flow that you were routing from you to the in the original graph.","Okay.

You know, in this example, actually in the original graph, there is no edge from seed to air.","There's only an edge for me to see. We're going to reduce its flow by five.","Then we have another forward edge. We're going to add five to the corresponding edge in the original graph.","We had another reverse edge. We're going to reduce by five the flow in the reverse of that in the original graph, and we have another forward edge.","We'll add five there. And let's do a full example of an overall augmentation step like this.","So I start I have some flow in my original graph.","I construct the residual network, but I have forward edges and I have reverse edges in my residual network.","This is the same example as before. I find an augmenting path in that network and I compute its bottleneck capacity,","the minimum residual capacity along that path in the residual network.","Then the flow augmentation step happens back in the original network where, for example, for every forward edge, I can add the bottleneck capacity.","So whereas previously from STC, we had zero flow.","After augmentation, I will now have five flow because this was a forward edge in the augmenting path in my residual network.","Alternatively, for a reverse edge such as from C to A in the residual network,","I'm going to reduce the flow by five in the reverse edge in the original graph.","The reverse of C to A in the original graph is A to C.","You'll notice that originally that had ten flow on it. I'm going to reduce that to five.","If this is necessary, in effect, to satisfy the flow conservation constraints.","And I continue in this fashion.","So I'm going to add five on this forward edge, reduce five on this one here that corresponds to the reverse edge from BD and then add five here.","Overall, if you compare what we started with to our augmented flow, you will see that we have increased the value of this flow by five,","which is equal to the bottleneck capacity of the augmenting path that we found.","Our question about this augmentation step further different on the table.","So.","So the question is about different choices of augmenting paths, which will be an important question we'll need to talk about for any augmenting path.","You're going to make progress.

For a forward edge, we add at most the remaining capacity because we add the bottleneck,","which was the minimum residual capacity across the entire pack.","For a reverse edge, we subtract at most the forward flow because the residual capacity for reverse edge was equal to the forward flow.","So when we subtract for reverse edge were never making the flow negative anywhere.","So both of these essentially just follow from the definitions of the residual capacities and the","fact that the bottleneck capacity is defined as the minimum residual capacity over the entire path.","So satisfying the capacity constraints is relatively easy to see.","I think it takes another minute or so to see that the automated flow will obey the flow conservation constraints,","but inflows will still equal outflows except at the source and the target.","But the critical observation is that they are only changed by the bottleneck capacity and they are only change for vertices on the augmenting path.","Those are the only vertices we need to worry about.","Their inflows and outflows changing are those on the augmenting path where potentially inflows and outflows","are just changing by being they might be increasing or decreasing by B because that's all that we do.","There are four cases then when you think about all combinations of inbound outbound forward edge, reverse edge,","so you end up with a little table like this that I'll leave you to ponder for a little bit before we come back next time.","The highlight of it is that in all of these cases, you're still going to be satisfying flow conservation.","You're not. You might be changing inflows and outflows, but you're necessarily still going to satisfy them in all the possible cases.","So we'll talk more about how to pull all this together into an algorithm for max loads and how to apply that next time.","Thank you, everyone.
