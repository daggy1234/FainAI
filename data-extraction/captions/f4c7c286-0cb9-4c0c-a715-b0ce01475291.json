Here's the argument for why this is a valid algorithm for computing a ton of logical order.","Consider some arbitrary edge from YouTube. I'd like to argue to you that if you've computed all the post times, etc.,","and you saw from greatest Lee's post time that you must have a greater post time than B so that this edge would go forward under that ordering.","This is what I would like to argue since the graph is a dag, I know that this isn't a back edge.","There are no back edges, there are no cycles, so it has to be one of the other kinds of edges.","If it is a tree edge or a forward edge, then the post time of the the endpoint must be less than the post time of the origin.","You cross this edge. This was by definition, if it was a cross edge, then again, the post time of the must have been less than the post time of you.","In either case, there can be a back edge. Isn't the only cases you the source of this edge or the predecessor along this","edge must have the greater post time then the successor v along this edge,","and will appear earlier in the ordering the runtime to compute a topological ordering in this fashion.","Right.","Compute the post times order from greatest in this post time is in log in plus m if you explicitly sought that is to say if you actually run all DFS,","get all the post times and then literally run merge sort on the vertices using the post times.","Right then you would get that in log in from the sorting of the vertices afterward,","which if you have a dense graph and it's close to end squared, then that's irrelevant and it's not going to make any difference to the runtime.","If you were a sparse graph,","you could do this more efficiently by rather than computing the post times and then sorting by simply having a stack and pushing","nodes onto your stack in post order as you explore the graph that would give you linear runtime even for a sparse graph."]},{"start_time":4680,"end_time":1000000,"image":"https://duke.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Thumb.aspx?eventTargetPID=b6b38d40-a182-4cd4-be2f-b1170146d338&sessionPID=7933740a-8357-4c8f-a7ef-b0ce01475289&number=26&isPrimary=false&absoluteTime=13352499780.534","captions":["I can't because I didn't read these facilities.
